# Babel

Babel is a Visual Studio Code extension for writers and developers. It helps you manage your pieces and write without distractions, focusing on what really matters: your story. Using *versions*, you can keep track of your drafts, revisions, translations and submissions on Babel view. Upcoming features include backups of your stories in cloud storage providers, language statistics, exporting to custom manuscript formats and integration with [The Grinder](https://thegrinder.diabolicalplots.com/).
